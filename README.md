# Hidden Search Widget

A project based on the fourth project in Brad Traversy & Florin Pop's Udemy course, "50 Projects in 50 Days". The instructor's original code is available at https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days

For this project, I only watched the introduction video that showed what I'd build. I did not look at any of the instructor's code until I had completed the project.

There is no actual search functionality here as there is nothing to search for. When a search is entered, an alert pops up with the searched phrase. The form would make a good addition to any project where a search bar is needed that doesn't take up space until it's clicked.
